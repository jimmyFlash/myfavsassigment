Assignment for Android Developer

1. Pick your top 10 fav books, movies, video games, food, or whatever you wish. Build an
Android app that lists these items. You donâ€™t need a backend service to load this list of items.
Use sensible hardcoding.
2. Create a rating system where you can rate each item. Order the list by the highest rated
item to lowest rated item. Re-order the list, if needed, when user ranks an item.
3. Using RxJava or similar technique, randomly rate items at random times, also re-ordering
the list as necessary. To elaborate this more put a button called RANDOM RATING and on
click of this button code will start rating random item at random time with random rating. And
on same button press again it will stop random rating.

Notes:
1. Feel free to use any UI elements or library.
2. Focus on test driven approach while coding this assignment.
3. Focus on good development practices like proper architecture, dependency injection, data
binding etc.
4. No need to write UI tests but a good unit test coverage is desired
